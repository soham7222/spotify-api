# Securing 

To secure your API endpoints that act as a wrapper over the Spotify API, you can implement authentication and authorization mechanisms. Here are some steps you can take:

1. ## Authentication:
    * Use OAuth 2.0: Spotify's API requires authentication via OAuth 2.0. Your API endpoints should handle authentication by obtaining access tokens from Spotify's authorization server. Users or client applications will need to authenticate themselves and provide these tokens with their requests.
    * Implement a token exchange mechanism: Your API can handle the exchange of user-provided authorization codes or refresh tokens for access tokens with Spotify's authorization server.

2. ## Authorization:
    * Scopes: Spotify API uses scopes to limit access to certain endpoints or actions. When users authenticate, your API should request appropriate scopes based on the operations your API endpoints perform.
    * Validate access tokens: Ensure that the access tokens provided by users are valid and have the necessary scopes required by your API endpoints.

3. ## API Key/Secret:
    * If your API is used by other applications rather than individual users, you might consider using API keys/secrets for authentication. However, Spotify's API primarily uses OAuth 2.0 for user-based authentication.

4. # Rate Limiting and Throttling:
    * Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to prevent abuse of your API endpoints. Control the number of requests a user or client can make within a specific timeframe.

5. # Secure Communication:
    * Use HTTPS to encrypt communication between clients and your API servers. This ensures that data transmitted between them remains secure and protected from eavesdropping.

6. # Error Handling:
    * Implement proper error handling for authentication failures, unauthorized access attempts, expired tokens, etc., providing informative error messages without exposing sensitive information.

## Example:

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
)

func Authenticate(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
	return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		// Check the access token in the request header or query parameter
		accessToken := r.Header.Get("Authorization")
		if accessToken == "" {
			http.Error(w, "Unauthorized", http.StatusUnauthorized)
			return
		}

		validateToken := yourMethodToValidation()

		// If validation fails, respond with an error
		if !validateToken(accessToken) {
			http.Error(w, "Invalid access token or insufficient permissions", http.StatusForbidden)
			return
		}

		// Token is valid, proceed to the next handler
		next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
	})
}

func YourAPIHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// Your API endpoint logic here
	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
	w.Write([]byte("Your API endpoint"))
}

func main() {
	// Create a new router instance (e.g., using Gorilla Mux)
	mux := http.NewServeMux()

	// Apply authentication middleware to your API endpoints
	apiHandler := http.HandlerFunc(YourAPIHandler)
	mux.Handle("/your-endpoint", Authenticate(apiHandler))

	// Start the server
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", mux)
}
```
